# Replaces the queue of intercom_minimal by a random access buffer of
# chunks, that allows to extract the chunks from the buffer in the
# correct (playing) order, even if the chunks have arrived in a
# different order.
#
# Buffering implies to spend a buffering time (buffering chunks) that
# increases the delay (the time from when a sample of audio is
# captured by the sender and played by the receiver). This time is
# necessary to hide the network jitter, when it exists. However, the
# buffer size (and therefore, the buffering time) is configurable by
# the receiver (it can be as smaller as only 1 chunk).
#
# The sorting of the chunks at the receiver implies that we must
# transit, with each chunk of audio, a chunk number to sequence
# them. We will call to this structure "packet".
